## Instructions
1) Set up radio transmitter and receiver
2) Use compass reading values to control servo rotation as replacement for the potentiometer found in original design
3) Create variable <truecompass> to reset compass heading for values greater than 180 degrees due to 180 degrees rotation range of servo
4) Set receiver to detect compass heading values and turn servo (Don't add superfluous code for visual representation of data as this reduces the sampling rate of sensor due to limited computational power)
5) Attach servo relay to micro:bit and attach power supply 
6) Print claw gripper components using 3D printer (Note CAD file may have incorrect dimensions so adjust accordingly p.s issues were found in cog and backplate)
7) Attach servo to allocated slot using screws found in servo packets
8) Join arms with short sections of filament p.s use soldering iron to flatten each side of filament to prevent them from slipping off
9) Congratulations, you now have a functional claw gripper!
